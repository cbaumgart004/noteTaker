#Note Generator

## Description

This project is a simple note taking app that writes to a local database. Created Notes are stored on the left hand pane. Selecting the notes will be rendered on the right side of the page. Notes can be added or deleted. This was an excellent exercise in the implementation of routes and middleware using express.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
